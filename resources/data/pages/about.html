        <p> Hi, I'm ded_moon! :3</p>
        <p>A Romanian tinkerer, [] and aspiring engineer. I'm part of an FTC robotics team and a crew of chaotic tech enthusiasts called SpicyVoltage, with which i participate in CTFs, robotics competitions, and all kinds of programming contest.</p>
        <p>On the homepage, you’ll find a list of my personal projects (mostly tech and engineering-related). If you have any questions, suggestions or just want to collab or chat go to the contact page.</p>
        <p>I’m into programming, electronics, and robotics (basically tech in all its forms), but also obsessed with civil engineering and urban planning (I’ve wasted 500+ hours in Cities: Skylines, no regrets (btw C:S 2 sucks) ). I’m also a fan of geography and history. Maps and historical weapon design just hit different.</p>
        <p>Outside of ESP-32s and WD-40, I freaking love nature and hiking. I’m also a regular contributor to OpenStreetMap (secret account with random name so i don't dox myself, of course).</p>
        <p>I speak Romanian (native) and English fluently; and I’m currently learning Arabic and Morse code, just for fun (and maybe for usage in WW3?).</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite things: raspberries, foxes(especially arctic ones!) and cyan. I also have a soft spot for Amsterdam (dutch and swiss infrastructure in genral).</p>
        <p>I also play a lot of videogames. If you’re curious, my Steam account is public and linked on the contact page.</p>
        <p>I don't know waht else to say, so this is it for now!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Take care, stay safe and stay spicy!</p>
