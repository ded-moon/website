# ded_moon's little website

---
This is a pure HTML and CSS website (with as little JavaScript as possible). No bloated frameworks, no heavy templates, no massive imported stylesheets. Just raw HTML and vanila JS with a terminal-inspired retro vibe.

After so many remakes, (with some reporpoused code, some help form ChatGPT when the CSS no longer wanted to CSS and snippets I found online) I have finaly made a website I can be proud off.

Originaly (in 2020 I think) I was inspired by my friend Tarball to make a website of my own. A lot has changed since then, but you should still check his out: [https://trblwlf.net/](https://trblwlf.net/)

This site does not collect or store any personal information (duh).

For the weather feature, your approximate location (based on IP address) is temporarily retrieved using the external service ipapi.co. This information is used only to display the local weather and is not stored by this site. 

Other than that, all interactions happen locally on your device. No cookies, no analytics, no ads (not everything needs to spy on you).
