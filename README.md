# ded_moon's little website

---

This is a mediocre personal website I created to learn web design and which I will use to showcase some of my personal and school related projects. It’s not very good right now, but it’s come a long way from how it looked when I first started working on it. 
I was inspired by my friend Tarball, whose website is still way better than mine. You should go check it out: [https://trblwlf.net/](https://trblwlf.net/)
